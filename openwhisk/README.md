## Action Templates  
In summary, till now, there are five templates:
* NodeJS 
* Go
* Java
* PHP
* Python

So you are not fixed to one language. If you wish to, you can change to Python or Java.

For the usage of every template you just need to make a **copy** of the template directory you wish and change it's name. If you like to develop in java just name the copy **java**-MyAction. Use always the template language as prefix of the name of your action.
