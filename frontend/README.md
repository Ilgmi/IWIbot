# IWIBot - Frontend

## Getting your environment set up  
1. You need to [install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) a nodejs runtime and the node package manager (npm) for your OS.
2. Then Install the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) globally `npm install -g @angular/cli`
3. If you haven't got git.. [go get it](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Then clone the Github project with `git clone https://github.com/HSKA-IWI-VSYS/IWIbot.git --branch=classifier_new` 
4. Navigate to the frontend folder inside the project
5. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies  
6. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in a Chrome Web-Browser! The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

* Run `ng generate component conversation` to generate a component named conversation
* Run `ng generate service conversation` to generate a service named conversation
